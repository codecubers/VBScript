# The `build` folder

## Overview

The `build` folder contains scripts for compiling the C# files and registering the output files, using the .NET Framework executables `csc.exe` and `regasm.exe` present on most Windows&reg; computers.  

In 64-bit systems, each of these `.exe` files have a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version. This project uses the 32-bit `csc.exe` and both `regasm.exe` files, when both are available.

The location of these `.exe` files is configurable in [exeLocations.bat].

## Options for compiling and registering the class libraries

1. The class libraries are generated automatically by running the required `Setup.vbs` in the project folder.  

2. To (re)compile and (re)register one or more of the `.cs` files, open the `build` folder and drag and drop the `.bat` file(s) having the same name as the `.cs` file(s) onto `build.vbs`.  

3. To (re)compile and (re)register all, double-click `build.vbs`.  

By default, the compiler doesn't sign the output files, as recommended by Microsoft, so (ignorable) warnings will be generated when files are compiled and registered.

In order to sign the output files,

- Download Visual Studio.  
- Right click the Developer Command Prompt for VS in the Start Menu.
- Select Run as adminstrator.
- Generate your keypair file by running a command similar to  
  `sn -k %UserProfile%\MyKeyPair.snk`
- Modify [_common.rsp]:
  - Comment out or delete `/delaysign`.
  - Uncomment the `/keyfile` line and specify the location and name of     the `.snk` file. It is recommended that you keep your keyfile out     of the project folders.
- See the [config folder ReadMe] for git configuration recommendations.

[exeLocations.bat]: ../config/exeLocations.bat "../config/exeLocations.bat"
[_common.rsp]: ../rsp/_common.rsp
[config folder ReadMe]: ../config/ReadMe.md#user-content-recommended-git-configuration
