## Overview

Fixer.hta can help to solve certain problems in 64-bit systems, allowing you to toggle script bitness without resorting to regedit.exe.  

## Background

For a 64-bit system configured in the typical manner, the default values of the following registry keys determine which executable is used to open .vbs, .wsf, and .hta files:  

``` paths
HKLM\Software\Classes\VBSFile\Shell\Open\Command
HKLM\Software\Classes\WSFFile\Shell\Open\Command
HKLM\Software\Classes\htafile\Shell\Open\Command
```

For a system configured to open .vbs or .wsf scripts with the 64-bit wscript, the command typically looks like  

`%SystemRoot%\System32\wscript.exe "%1" %*`

## How it works

Fixer.hta allows you to toggle the bitness without resorting to regedit.exe:

When you select the *32 bit* radio button, Fixer.hta changes the `System32` in the above command to `SysWow64`. As a result, the next time any script of the specified type is started, the 32-bit .exe file will be used to open it.

## Fixing the fixer

One situation where you might have to jump start this process is when .hta files are configured to open with the 32-bit mshta.exe. In this case, the radio buttons have no effect: the command stays at `...\SysWow64\...`. One way to force Fixer.hta to open with the 64-bit mshta.exe, is

- Open a cmd.exe console window at %SystemRoot%\System32
- Type `mshta.exe "<project folder>\examples\Fixer.hta"`
